#Random Location

My first RubyMotion app. Used the Google Maps API. 

Always starts a Washington D.C and when you press random. It generates a
random latitude and longitude and locates a random place

#TODO
I didn't know how I could refactor duplicated code, still need to figure
that out

Also, want to possibly locate random capitals instead of complete random
location


#Challenges
1) Figuring out how the random works in RubyMotion
2) Making the button work to find a random location.
